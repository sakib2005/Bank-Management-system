This is a bank management project developed using the C programming language, and the project objective is to make it easier for bankers to manage and carry out their tasks effectively. A bank is a financial institution that takes public deposits, produces demand deposits, and provides loans. Furthermore, it is typical for a bank to have thousands of customers, and some banks may even have a million customers. As a result, it is common for bankers to have a record system to keep track of their customers' information. However, bankers in the past needed to do all the tasks using handwritten documents, so it is very typical for people to make mistakes when they need to do such a task by hand. Furthermore, if a bank has a high number of clients, the stress on its personnel can be excessive. As a result, our goal with this project is to make dealing with those data simple and straightforward. Our main objective is to develop a software program for managing the entire bank process related to  Administration accounts and customer accounts  and to  keep track of their property and their various transaction processes efficiently. We are attempting to create a program that will allow bankers to save their data while also being able to do all of the usual operations with a few clicks on the screen. This program will also take care of tasks such as data maintenance, data generation, data removal, and data updates for the Client. As a result, it is very unlikely for a mistake to occur. The programming language used to develop this project is C code. 

## Admin
This part handles all the tasks that have to do with the administration, like creating an account and viewing the list of clients. Admins need to enter a password to enter their domain.

### Create an account
In this part of the program, we ask users to enter  all the data that is necessary for creating an account like name, passport number, email address etc.

### Viewing clients list 
In the “Viewing clients list” we print out the list of all clients from a separate file using the file management system.

## Client 
This part manages all the tasks related to the clients. Things like:
### Viewing user information
This part of the application prints out all the information of the users according to their ID.
### Making deposits
This part adds the amount that the client wants to deposit.
### Withdrawing money
This part subtracts the amount that the client wants to withdraw.
### Checking Balances
This part of the program prints the balance of the users according to their ID.


The list of clients and their data is managed by a unique ID. This ID is different for everyone, and the entry to the client site is secured by a password. No one can enter their domain without it.
We faced a number of difficulties while doing this assignment. Firstly, for this assignment, we needed to make a list of the clients with details, and for that, we used four different arrays to store their details. Even though we could solve the problem by doing this, this is only a temporary solution. We could only store a very selective number of people's descriptions with this type of approach, but it won't be possible if we want to have a large collection of people's details. Secondly, we have faced some kind of compiler. The output that we are expecting is not the same for all of our group members. While most of us are getting the correct answer, some of us are getting an output that is a bit more or less than the actual output.
